Steps to run the experiments performed in this project:-

1. Setup an 'n'-node LAN spark cluster with one master node (similar to CloudLab Assignment 2) using CloudLab or any other distributed service provider.
2. run 'spark-submit spark_nas.py' from the spark directory's bin folder in the master node.
3. Rerun the above line with different configurations to test different dataset sizes, dataset complexities and sample spaces.
4. For each run, the results for single and multi-node performance are written a results.txt file.
